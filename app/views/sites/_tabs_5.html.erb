<h2>Set Up Your CNAME Records</h2>
<p>Below are instructions for updating the CNAME record for your domain.<p>
<ul class="simplelist">
	<li>Go to your registrar (or hosting provider if you have changed the nameservers to them).</li>
	<li>Find your DNS settings</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions to point the CNAME record (sub-domain) for your domain.</li>
	<li>Point the desired subdomain to <strong> host.deskgator.com</strong></li>
</ul>

<em><strong>NOTE:</strong> You need to change your domainâ€™s (or sub-domainâ€™s) CNAME record, not its nameservers. And, you donâ€™t need to forward or redirect anything, you only need to change the CNAME Record.</em>
